# Crowdfunding-ETL_Mod_8
In this Challenge, Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebook allowed me to extract and transform phases. I extracted and transformed the backersâ€™ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that was exported as a CSV file. I then completed the load phase using the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. After ecah task is completed, a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database will be done by using SQL queries. All images and data will be saved into the Crowdfunding folder and submitted.
